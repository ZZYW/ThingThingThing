Guidelines when creating lightmaps in a new scene:

-If you get some black lines seams on your objects that’s because in Unity 5 the “Baked padding” option for lightmaps (in the “Lighting/baked GI” tab) which normally fixes this problem (when set to 6 or 7) doesn’t work, it’s broken.

-The first solution would be to tweak the “Scale In Lightmaps” value in the “lighting/Object” tab for the object having the black lines. 
Start with 6 then you can go up to 20,30 or 40 this really depends on each scene. Refer to the lightmapped example scenes ending with “_LM”, this will give you an idea on how to fix this problem.

-If you are still getting black lines, you can resort to the second solution. Select the models in the “models” folder, and in the “import settings” in the inspector, under “advanced” set “Hard Angle” to 10. This will affect the smoothing groups a bit but will get rid of the black lines, only do this as a last resort.

-Hopefully in the future, Unity will fix the “Baked padding” bug and the black lines will disappear forever.
