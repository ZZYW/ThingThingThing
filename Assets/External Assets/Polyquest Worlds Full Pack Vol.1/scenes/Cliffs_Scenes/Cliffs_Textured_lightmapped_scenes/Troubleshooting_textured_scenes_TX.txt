Guidelines for using textures:

-When opening textured example scenes containing the “_TX” letters, make sure you check “swap UVs” ON for all models in these 3 folders:
Assets\models\models_standard”
Assets\models\models_multimat” 
Assets\models\models_layered” 


-This is to make sure Unity uses the second UV set of the models where everything is unwrapped to handle image textures correctly. 

-Otherwise the scenes with the “_TX” letters will appear broken.
